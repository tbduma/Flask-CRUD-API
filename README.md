# Flask CRUD API - Backend and API Development

This project contains a Flask-based RESTful API for managing product information. The API supports CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add, retrieve, update, and delete product entries.

## Setting Up and Running the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS (to handle CORS issues)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tbduma/Flask-CRUD-API.git
    cd Flask-CRUD-API
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. Verify the server is running:
   - Open a browser or Postman and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - The API should be working correctly.
